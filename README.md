# Base QuickCheck - A Property Based / Randomized Testing Library Compatible with Base

Base QuickCheck is a OCaml framework for creating property based tests that is fully compatible with the ***[Base](https://opensource.janestreet.com/base/)*** library and its types. 

What follows below is essentially a tutorial that demonstrates how to go about writing tests. There are also detailed
explanations about each of the components one needs to know about to write his/her own tests. We explain each section with
the help of some examples.
